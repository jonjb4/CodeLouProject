          Worship at Highland UMC
        </h1>
        <p>
          We worship as a church at 10:50 a.m. every Sunday. We love to sing hymns of praise and to read the Psalms responsively.
        </p>  
        <p>
The preaching at Highland UMC is Christ-centered and recognizes that the living Word of God can deform, reform and transform us through the power of the Holy Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
Sermons seek to challenge the listener to apply Biblical truths practically in daily living and to perservere as a disciple of Christ.  In recognition of our membership with the church universal, we typically preach from the lectionary during the Lenten and Advent seasons.
        </p>
        <p>
We celebrate Holy Communion every week as the center-piece of worship, which allows us to proclaim with one voice the mystery of our faith "Christ has died, Christ is risen, Christ will come again!"
        </p>
        <p>
Childcare is available during the worship service but children are strongly encouraged to participate and worship together with their families and with the larger church family.

          We gather at 5:30pm every Wednesday for a mid-week time of renewal and contemplation as we pray and seek after God's direction for our church and our families.
